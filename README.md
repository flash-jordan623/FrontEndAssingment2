# The Assignment
* The Assignment consists of creating a website using HTML5,
CSS3 and JavaScript, incorporating all elements to produce
a fully functional and architecturally correct site.

* My Website is simple, vintage, clean and professional. Aimed towards
the actual module handbook itself.
Easy to navigate, use and understand.

# The Code
* Within the site HTML5 is used for the body with external
CSS3 files.
* Also included is an internal JavaScript portion.

# The Design
* A Wireframe sketch was used within the initial design phase.
Overall, the design in comparison with the finished site are
quite comparable other than less images and text added, to keep
in line with the simple and somewhat vintage feel.

* See 'sketches.jpg' for first designs.

# Issues
* One main issue was the "Module Details" page was not aligned when
opened on a large desktop monitor rather than on a laptop monitor
on which it was created.
However once size restrictions were fully implemented this issue was
corrected.

# Extras
* The site includes some CSS3 animations on each page, including the site map.
* JavaScript slideshows are also included on the homepage.
