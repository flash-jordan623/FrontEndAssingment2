  <h2>University policy</h2>
<div id="flex1">
  <b>Anonymous marking</b><br>

  Because of the practical nature of this module, there will be no anonymous marking,

   as the origin of each students’ work is obvious to the tutors from workshop sessions.<br><br>
<div id="flex4">
<b>  Late work</b><br>

  This will be penalised according to university rules and regulations.
  These rules also apply to work submitted after a 14-day extension deadline authorised by the Module Tutor/Leader.
<br><br>
  Coursework received after 2.00pm on the deadline date : without an agreed extension will
   be stamped ‘late’ and marked down accordingly. The centre (FOTAC) will close promptly at the published times,
    so work cannot be accepted until 9.00am on the following working day.

  Coursework submitted within 7 days from the deadline : without prior permission from the Module Tutor/Leader will be subject to a cap of 40%

  Coursework submitted later than 7 days after the deadline : with no prior notice will receive a mark of 0%.
</div>
<div id="flex2">
<b>  Extensions </b><br>

  These may be granted for significant reasons (e.g. health issues, serious family problems, etc.)
  They cannot be granted for bad the management, pressure from other module deadlines, minor illness, etc.
<br><br>
<u>  Deferrals, failure and reassessment</u>

  In very exceptional circumstances, a deferral may be granted.

  If you are judged to have failed the course, contact your workshop tutor as soon as possible for advice on what
  practical work to undertake in order to resubmit for reassessment, and when studio facilities will be available, if required.
</div>
<div id="flex3">
<b>  Plagiarism (using work from other sources)</b><br>

  Before you write anything, read the DMU library page “What is plagiarism”. As for copying code,
  developers often examine source code from other sites and adapt features they like into their own work.<br><br>
   However, pre–designed templates that entire designs, copying tutorials mindlessly, or taking code wholly
    or substantially from other sources is not acceptable for assessments, as you will learn very little.
    So always explain if and how you have adapted any third-party code or online tutorials and examples
     to demonstrate that you understand what you’re doing.
<br><br>
  The practical work submitted for this course must be your own, so be aware that tutors know how to check source code in detail.
  The essay will be submitted via Turnitin, which highlights copied text.

  For further information, please refer to the student regulations on the DMU website.
